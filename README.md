Calculate Prime Numbers in a Range

This program is a simple Prime Number Calculator built using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library for GUI. It allows users to input a range by specifying a lower and upper limit and calculates the prime numbers within that range using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which is an efficient method for finding prime numbers.
